## dream-initial

- Description: Reach Dream
- Status: PASS
- Final prompt: Define the Dream of Mindd or choose an option.
- Final card text: Vision comes from the Greek visio, meaning to see. A real visionary dreams of a future image before it is obvious. That is why this step is called Dream. A Dream is a desired future image.

This is not a revenue goal, not a tactic, and not a disguised product or service pitch. It is a human future image that creates emotional resonance. It must be effect-first, not tool-first or execution-first. Please try a first draft. For example: "Mindd dreams of a world in which creativity in advertising empowers brands to connect with people on a deeper level."
- Final visible buttons: Tell me more about why a dream matters | Do a small exercise that helps to define your dream.

## bigwhy-initial

- Description: Reach Big Why
- Status: PASS
- Final prompt: Share your thoughts or choose an option.
- Final card text: Many companies have a 'Why' statement that sounds good on a website, but the real Big Why goes deeper. It’s the internal, sometimes raw reason that sits above the Dream and Purpose—your true roof. The Dream is your desired future image; the Purpose is why that Dream matters to you and your business. The Big Why is the deeper, universal meaning-layer: the 'should-be-true' about people or the world that makes the Dream and Purpose feel urgent and worth sacrifice. This is not a marketing slogan or a value label; it’s the backbone that guides tough choices, even when nobody is watching. It doesn’t need to be shared publicly—sometimes it’s better if it isn’t. What matters is that it’s honest and strong enough to guide you when things get tough.

Ready to explore your Big Why? You can start now or get more explanation first.

## role-initial

- Description: Reach Role
- Status: PASS
- Final prompt: Define the Role of Mindd or choose an option.
- Final card text: Let's get clear on your Role. Your Role is the chosen position that translates your Dream, Purpose, and Big Why into a consistent contribution. It's not about titles, tasks, or services, but about the stance your business takes in the world.

A clear Role creates consequences: it makes it easier to say no, reduces randomness, and gives your business a stronger backbone. Your Role is about contribution, not completion, because your Dream can remain bigger than your company. If you're ever unsure, remember that activity is execution, while your Role is the stable position and effect that stays true even when tactics change. I'll help you find the right Role for Mindd.
