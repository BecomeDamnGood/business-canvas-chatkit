This is not a marketing slogan or a value label; it’s the backbone that guides tough choices, even when nobody is watching. It doesn’t need to be shared publicly—sometimes it’s better if it isn’t. What matters is that it’s honest and strong enough to guide you when things get tough.\n\nReady to explore your Big Why? You can start now or get more explanation first.",
