## dream-initial

It must be effect-first, not tool-first or execution-first. Please share your first draft, even if rough. For example: "Mindd dreams of a world in which creativity in advertising brings people and brands closer together."
- Final visible buttons: Tell me more about why a dream matters | Do a small exercise that helps to define your dream.
